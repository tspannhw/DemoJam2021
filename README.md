# DemoJam2021

During the Demo Jam (https://www.cloudera.com/about/events/webinars/demo-jam-live-expands-nifi-kafka-flink.html) we showed some use cases with Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka and Apache Flink.  We used the latest tools from Cloudera to quickly build, deploy, scale, monitor and manage our real-time streaming application.   We used Cloudera Streams Messaging Manager (SMM) for Kafka, SQL Stream Builder for Flink and Cloudera Flow Management on Data Hub for NiFi.   We ran in public and private clouds and local environments seamlessly.

Are you looking for a simpler way to accelerate data ingestion, transformation, processing, buffering, and real-time analytics?  This new demo jam webinar will showcase our latest streaming data platform, Cloudera DataFlow, using Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, and Apache Flink. We will demonstrate how much easier it is to build end-to-end processing of data streams and real-time analytics.  Just like the previous session, this will be a no-slides, highly interactive demo-only session where you get to choose what you want to see based on live polling.

THIS SESSION IS LED BY TIM SPANN, PRINCIPAL DATAFLOW FIELD ENGINEER AT CLOUDERA. REGISTER TODAY AND JOIN TIM, WHO WILL SHOWCASE:
How to build an event-driven streaming application

What are the best use cases for NiFi, Kafka, and Flink

Provide an example of CDF platform processing data streams
